# Sid Mann's README
A personal communication guide to share my working style and preferences 

## What are your primary goals as a human being?
- Impact: Have a positive, lasting impact on people I interact with. Letting empathy guide my interactions.
- Growth: To continually grow as a human being, in my technical skills, and as a communicator. Knowing that growth only happens outside of my comfort zone.
- Joy: Live my life in the pursuit of things that bring me joy!

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?
- I work best in 1:1 and small group settings. In large groups I tend to silently listen and absorb rather than interject. 
- As an introvert, I'm a big listener and very deliberate with my responses. Sometimes this looks like me taking long pauses to think before responding. This is part of me being an intentional communicator, rather than an indication that I am not engaged!
- I am a processer, often I need to marinate on an idea and don't have an immediate response in the moment. Sometimes written communication is easier for me to adequately capture what I'm thinking.

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
- I live for my calendar and a daily to do list.
- I like to explore all possible solutions to a problem on my own before reaching out for help.
- I am shy around new people which can sometimes be interpreted as being unfriendly, but I assure you I am excited to get to know you and I open up over time.
- I have a hard time with auditory processing (I struggle to watch a movie without captions) so sometimes big ideas communicated verbally take me longer to process. Captions or ideas on a powerpoint/other visual form help tremendously.

## How can you best work with me?
- Direct feedback. I take feedback as a means to grow and learn and would prefer to hear feedback in the moment so I can incorporate it into my work. 
- Relationships and communication are a two way street, if I can do something to make working together a more positive experience I would love to talk about it.

## What are your pet peeves?
- Hinting or being passive aggressive rather than directly communicating a need to me.
- Unreliability/failing to follow through or stick to commitments.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
- Overthinking to the point of indecision.
- Self-doubt.
